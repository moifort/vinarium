# Vinarium - Project Directives

## Language

Everything versioned and technical is written in **English**: commit messages, code, code comments, and documentation (README, this file). This now includes `CHANGELOG.md`, which is the **English source of truth**. The **only** French in the repo is user-facing copy — `CHANGELOG.fr.md` (the served French translation) and the iOS app's on-screen text. Never mix languages in a commit message or a comment.

The changelog lives in two files, each organized newest-version-first with three sub-sections (only those that have content): `CHANGELOG.md` uses `### New` / `### Fixes` / `### Performance`, and `CHANGELOG.fr.md` mirrors it with `### Nouveautés` / `### Corrections` / `### Performance`. Only log **consequential** changes — cosmetic tweaks (renaming a label, changing a subtitle, dropping a counter) have no impact and are excluded. Note: the server parser only reads `## ` headings and bullets, so `###` sub-headings are ignored and the app renders a flat list — the sections are organizational for the repo.

## Build & Verification Commands

- **Backend typecheck**: `bun tsc --noEmit`
- **Regenerate types** (if routes changed): `bunx nitro prepare` (run before `bun tsc`)
- **iOS build**:
  ```
  DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer xcodebuild -project ios/Vinarium.xcodeproj -scheme Vinarium -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17,OS=26.2' build
  ```
- **Unit tests**: `bun test`
- **Test coverage**: `bun test --coverage`
- **Linter**: `bunx biome check`
- **Runtime**: always use `bun`/`bunx`, never `npm`/`npx`
- **GraphQL codegen** (if the schema changed): `bun run generate:graphql` (regenerates `shared/schema.graphql`), then `cd ios && apollo-ios-cli generate` (config `ios/apollo-codegen-config.json`)

## Development Workflow

1. Always verify the build before committing (backend `bun tsc --noEmit` + `xcodebuild` depending on what was touched)
2. Run `bunx nitro prepare` before `bun tsc` if routes were added/modified
3. After each completed task: run an expert code review (`superpowers:requesting-code-review`) before committing
4. **Commit freely**: group and commit changes as you see fit without asking the user — don't ask about grouping, you decide.
5. **Never push until the user explicitly says "push".** Commits accumulate locally; pushing is user-gated.

### Push protocol (only when the user says "push")

Before pushing, update the user-facing surfaces, then push:

1. **README** (`README.md`): update the Features list / Tech Stack if the pushed work changed them.
2. **README previews** (`screenshots/*.png`): regenerate the affected screenshots if the touched UI changed visually.
3. **Changelog** (`CHANGELOG.md` + `CHANGELOG.fr.md`): add the English entries under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` (source of truth), then add the French translation under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.fr.md` (the served copy). Use the `### New`/`### Fixes`/`### Performance` (EN) and `### Nouveautés`/`### Corrections`/`### Performance` (FR) sub-sections, and only log consequential changes (exclude renames, subtitle changes, and other cosmetic tweaks). Then run `bun run generate:assets` to regenerate `server/system/changelog-content.ts` from `CHANGELOG.fr.md` (the iOS-facing asset served via GraphQL — never edit it by hand).
4. **iOS GraphQL API** (if the GraphQL schema changed): run `bun run generate:graphql`, then `cd ios && apollo-ios-cli generate`, and commit the regenerated `shared/schema.graphql` and `ios/Vinarium/Generated/GraphQL/` so the app's typed operations stay in sync with the deployed schema.
5. Push.

## Skills

- Use the `swiftui-expert-skill` skill for all SwiftUI code
- Use the `nitro-backend` skill for all backend Nitro/H3 code
- Use the `superpowers:requesting-code-review` skill for all code reviews

## Backend Patterns (TypeScript/Nitro)

Patterns live in `docs/`; the essentials:

- **Domain architecture** — `server/domain/{domain}/` with `types.ts`, `primitives.ts`, `command.ts` (`XxxCommand` namespace), `query.ts` (`XxxQuery` namespace), optional `business-rules.ts` / `use-case.ts`, and `infrastructure/{repository.ts, graphql/}`. Repositories are bare functions (`import * as repository`), private to the domain. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [docs/domain-guide.md](docs/domain-guide.md).
- **Branded types** — `ts-brand` + Zod constructors in `primitives.ts`; one GraphQL scalar per brand. See [docs/branded-types.md](docs/branded-types.md).
- **Errors** — commands return bare string-literal outcomes (`'not-found' as const`) or the domain value; resolvers map them with `match().exhaustive()` + `notFound`/`badUserInput` helpers. `throw` for impossible states. See [docs/error-handling.md](docs/error-handling.md).
- **Storage** — native Firestore (`firebase-admin`) via `db()` from `server/system/firebase.ts`, only inside `infrastructure/repository.ts`. Helpers in `server/utils/firestore.ts` (`genericDataConverter`, `atomically`, `deleteInBatches`, `bulkSave`, `userBeverageRecordRepository`). See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#storage).
- **GraphQL** — Apollo Server + Pothos, single endpoint `POST /graphql`. Nested `Beverage` satellite fields must never scan a collection or read one doc per parent row (N+1) — they resolve through the per-request loaders in `server/domain/shared/graphql/loaders.ts`. See [docs/api-patterns.md](docs/api-patterns.md).
- **Naming** — function names carry the business concept, not the technical pattern. The name IS the rule or action. See [docs/code-style.md](docs/code-style.md).
- **Observability** — never `console.*`; log via `createLogger(tag)` from `server/system/logger.ts` (consola). Sentry (error capture + domain-namespace tracing) activates only when `NITRO_SENTRY_DSN` is set — see `server/plugins/00-sentry.ts` and `server/system/sentry/`.
- **Tests** — `bun:test`, three suffixes: `*.unit.test.ts` (pure functions/primitives), `*.int.test.ts` (commands/queries against the fake Firestore), `*.feat.test.ts` (GraphQL against the schema). Mock via `mock.module('~/system/firebase', () => ({ db: fakeDb }))`; assert read budgets with the split `fake.docReads`/`fake.queryReads`, not the combined `fake.reads`. Optional BDD DSL in `server/test/bdd.ts`. See [docs/domain-guide.md](docs/domain-guide.md#tests).
- **Formatter** — Biome (spaces, single quotes, no semicolons, line width 100).

## Database Migrations

- Location: `server/system/migration/`
- Forward-only sequential migrations, no rollback
- Meta tracked in the Firestore collection `migration-meta` (doc `state`)
- Triggered by `POST /admin/migrate` (`server/routes/admin/migrate.post.ts`), called by `scripts/bootstrap.sh` during provisioning — no boot-time plugin
- To add a migration: create `server/system/migration/migrations/NNNN-name.ts`, register in `migrations/index.ts`
- Migration `version` uses branded `MigrationVersion` (starts at 1, version 0 is reserved sentinel)
- Migrations receive a `MigrationContext` with the Firestore `db`, return `MigrationResult`
- Runner wraps each migration in try/catch — migrations don't need their own error handling
- **When to migrate**: renaming a field, changing a field's structure, changing enum values, removing stale data
- **No migration needed**: adding a new optional (`?`) field, adding a new collection, changing query logic/routes

Full guide (writing/testing a migration): [docs/migrations.md](docs/migrations.md).

## iOS Patterns (SwiftUI)

- Target: iOS 26.0, Swift 6 (strict concurrency); `@MainActor` on ViewModels, `Sendable` on model types.
- Feature structure `ios/Vinarium/Features/{Feature}/` with the coordinator `{Feature}View.swift` at the root and `components/{pages,organisms,molecules}` below; cross-feature atoms in `ios/Vinarium/Shared/Components/`. The feature-root `*View` is the coordinator (owns the ViewModel, navigation, sheets, domain→primitive mapping); the `*Page` is pure and previewable. Primitive-first leaf views, organisms as mapping boundaries, previews as storybook. See [docs/ios-guide.md](docs/ios-guide.md).
- GraphQL over Apollo iOS (`GraphQLClient` singleton, Firebase Bearer auth); `.graphql` operations in `Features/{Feature}/GraphQL/`, generated types in `Generated/GraphQL/` (namespace `VinariumGraphQL`).
- Xcode uses `fileSystemSynchronizedGroups` (no need to manually add files). `DEVELOPER_DIR` required because `xcode-select` points to CommandLineTools.

## App Store Distribution

Full checklist in `ios/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md`. Build with the latest **final** Xcode (currently 26.6 / `17F113`, SDK `23F81a`) — never a beta/RC Xcode, and never an older release once a newer final ships. Both trigger **ITMS-90111** (Unsupported SDK or Xcode version) on upload.

**Automated release flow** (full procedure in `ios/APP_STORE_SUBMISSION.md`), in order:
1. Write the release notes (French) under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. **Push `main`** — `deploy.yml` deploys the backend *and* stamps `## Unreleased` → `## YYYY.MM.DD`, regenerating the served changelog asset. This step is **required for the in-app changelog**: the app renders a dated `## YYYY.MM.DD` heading as a proper release, but `## Unreleased` shows literally as "Unreleased", so the notes only display correctly once a `main` deploy has versioned them.
3. **Push a `ios-v<version>` tag** — runs `.github/workflows/release-ios.yml` (macOS runner, final Xcode): archive → export → upload to App Store Connect via the App Store Connect API key (automatic signing). Build number = `git rev-list --count HEAD` (no manual `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` bump), marketing version from the tag.

Because the CI runner is on a **final** macOS, the `BuildMachineOSBuild` patch below only concerns **local** archives made on the beta-macOS dev Mac.

**The dev Mac runs a beta macOS**, so archives made locally get a prerelease `BuildMachineOSBuild` stamp that App Store validation also rejects with ITMS-90111. After archiving, patch it to the latest **public** macOS build number *before* `-exportArchive` (export re-signs, so the patch survives):

```bash
# after `xcodebuild ... archive`, before `-exportArchive`:
plutil -replace BuildMachineOSBuild -string '<latest public macOS build>' \
  build/Vinarium.xcarchive/Products/Applications/Vinarium.app/Info.plist
```

Look up the current public macOS build at https://developer.apple.com/news/releases (pick the released macOS, not a beta/RC). Verify `DTXcodeBuild`/`DTSDKBuild` are untouched, then export. The clean alternative is to archive on a non-beta macOS (e.g. a GitHub Actions macOS runner with the final Xcode) — no patch needed. Bump `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` (4 occurrences in `project.pbxproj`) for every new upload.

## API Token

The API token is used for authentication when `NITRO_API_TOKEN` is set. To rotate the token, update it in:
- `.env` (`NITRO_API_TOKEN=...`)
- `ios/Vinarium/Shared/Secrets.swift` (gitignored)
- `ios/VinariumUITests/Support/TestSecrets.swift` (gitignored)

See `.example` files next to the Secrets files for the expected format.

## Sentry Error Triage

When the user asks to look at a Sentry error (usually with an issue URL or ID), run this workflow:

1. **Token** — read `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` from `.env` (gitignored; a Sentry user auth token, `sntryu_...`). Never echo, print, or commit it. Load it with `set -a; . ./.env; set +a` and reference `$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` only inside the header.
2. **Read the issue** — the org is `polyforms`; take `{issue_id}` from the URL the user pastes (e.g. `https://polyforms.sentry.io/issues/<id>/`). Fetch context via the REST API with `-H "Authorization: Bearer $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"`:
   - `GET https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org}/issues/{issue_id}/`
   - `GET https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org}/issues/{issue_id}/events/latest/`
3. **Diagnose** — use `superpowers:systematic-debugging`; trace the stack to the domain code.
4. **Fix** the bug.
5. **Regression test** — if it's a serious functional bug, write a test that fails before the fix and passes after (`*.unit/int/feat.test.ts` per the domain test conventions).
6. **Verify locally** — `bun tsc --noEmit` (+ `bunx nitro prepare` first if routes changed) and `bun test`.
7. **Commit** — push stays user-gated (never push until the user says "push").
8. **Resolve** — only **after** the user has pushed **and** CI is green (verify with `gh run list`/`watch` on `main`), mark the issue resolved:
   `PUT https://sentry.io/api/0/organizations/{org}/issues/{issue_id}/` with body `{"status":"resolved"}` and the same Bearer header.

## iOS Simulator

- Device: iPhone 17, OS 26.2

## iOS Physical Device Install

- After finishing a task (especially one touching iOS), **offer** to install it on the physical iPhone "TiPhone junior" (UDID `00008130-000A2068029A001C`, automatic dev signing, team `46C337T7YN`). Never install automatically — ask first, run only after a yes.
- On a yes, run `scripts/install-device.sh` to build → install → launch.
- The device must be connected, unlocked, and trusted. Relay the raw `xcodebuild`/`devicectl` output — don't claim success without it.
