  //  1. Leave the household first, so a shared cellar's config stays with the
  //     remaining members and ownership passes on before the caller's data goes.
  //  2. Wipe every per-user collection in parallel (independent domains). This
  //     forgets our entitlement record but does NOT cancel the App Store
  //     subscription — Apple owns that lifecycle; the app warns the user.
  //  3. Drop the profile.
  //  4. Delete the Firebase Auth user LAST: if an earlier step fails the user is
  //     still signed in and can retry; deleting auth first would strand the data.
