# Backend Architecture

## Overview

The backend follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture built on [Nitro](https://nitro.build/) with TypeScript, native Firestore storage, and branded types. The public API is GraphQL only (a single `POST /graphql`), plus one operational route (`POST /admin/migrate`).

## Theoretical Foundations

This architecture draws from two foundational DDD books:

- **Eric Evans** — *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software* (2003)
- **Scott Wlashin** — *Domain Modeling Made Functional: Tackle Software Complexity with Domain-Driven Design and F#* (2018)

**Evans concepts used in this project:**

| Concept | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Bounded Context | Each `server/domain/{domain}/` is a self-contained context with clear boundaries |
| Ubiquitous Language | Function and type names carry business meaning, not technical jargon |
| Value Objects | Branded types in `types.ts` — identity through value, not reference |
| Entities | Domain types with an `id` field in `types.ts` |
| Repository | `infrastructure/repository.ts` — abstracts Firestore, private to the bounded context |
| Application Services | `query.ts`, `command.ts`, `use-case.ts` — orchestrate domain operations |
| Anti-Corruption Layer | Zod validation at domain boundaries prevents invalid data from entering |

**Wlashin concepts used in this project:**

| Concept | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Making illegal states unrepresentable | Branded types + Zod constructors in `primitives.ts`, discriminated unions in `types.ts` |
| Railway-Oriented Programming | String-literal outcomes returned from commands — reserved for expected business outcomes only, not technical errors. `throw` for impossible states. |
| Types as documentation | Branded types make the domain model self-documenting |
| Pure domain functions | `business-rules.ts` — no IO, no async, pure input/output |

```

There is **no `read-model/` layer and no event bus**. Composite, cross-domain reads live in two places: the domain `query.ts` (which may call other domains' public `Query` namespaces) and the GraphQL nested resolvers (which fan out through per-request loaders). See [Cross-Domain Reads](#cross-domain-reads) below.

## Layers

### Domain Layer (`server/domain/`)

Each domain is a self-contained bounded context:

- **types.ts** — Branded types using `ts-brand`, plus discriminated unions. Evans: Value Objects (identity through value) and Entities (types with an `id`).
- **primitives.ts** — Zod constructors that validate and brand raw values. Wlashin: making illegal states unrepresentable — if it parses, it's valid.
- **infrastructure/repository.ts** — Firestore access (private, never imported from outside the domain). A module of bare exported functions, imported as `* as repository` from `command.ts`/`query.ts`. Evans: Repository pattern — abstracts persistence behind a domain-oriented interface.
- **query.ts** — Public read operations (exported `XxxQuery` namespace). Evans: the public contract of the bounded context.
- **command.ts** — Public write operations (exported `XxxCommand` namespace). Evans: Application Service — orchestrates domain logic and exposes it to the outside.
- **use-case.ts** — (optional) Multi-domain orchestrations. Names carry business intent (`addWithTasting`, `removeCompletely` — never `handleCreate`). No direct storage access. Evans: Application Service coordinating multiple bounded contexts.
- **business-rules.ts** — (optional) Pure functions (no IO, no async). Function names ARE the business concept (`beverageStatus`, `readyToDrink` — never `computeBeverageStatus`). 100% test coverage required. Wlashin: pure domain functions — all logic is testable without infrastructure.

### GraphQL Layer (`server/domain/{domain}/infrastructure/graphql/` + `server/domain/shared/graphql/`)

Code-first GraphQL API using Apollo Server + [Pothos](https://pothos-graphql.dev/). The schema is assembled from per-domain `infrastructure/graphql/` folders; the shared infrastructure lives in `server/domain/shared/graphql/`:

- **builder.ts** — the Pothos `SchemaBuilder`, `GraphQLContext` type (`event`, `userId`, `loaders`), and the `Scalars` map. `DefaultFieldNullability: false` — every field is non-null unless it opts in with `nullable: true`.
- **scalars.ts** — one custom scalar per branded type. Resolvers receive pre-validated branded args; invalid input becomes a `BAD_USER_INPUT` GraphQL error at parse time.
- **schema.ts** — imports every domain's GraphQL module (registering its types/queries/mutations on the shared `builder`) and exports the assembled schema.
- **errors.ts** — `notFound`, `badUserInput`, `domainError` — `never`-returning helpers that throw a `GraphQLError` with an `extensions.code`. They sit in `match()` arms while the success arm keeps the resolver's inferred type.
- **loaders.ts** — per-request satellite loaders (see below).
- **Types** reference domain types as Pothos backing models — no type duplication (`builder.objectRef<Beverage>('Beverage')`).
- **Queries/Mutations** delegate to domain `Query`/`Command`/`UseCase` namespaces and map string-literal outcomes to HTTP-shaped GraphQL errors with `match().exhaustive()`.
- **Schema SDL** exported to `shared/schema.graphql` (`bun run generate:graphql`) for Apollo iOS codegen.

See [api-patterns.md](./api-patterns.md) for resolver patterns and [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) for outcome mapping.

### Route Layer (`server/routes/`)

Only two routes exist. `graphql.ts` builds a fresh loader set per request and hands the H3 event to Apollo Server. `admin/migrate.post.ts` runs pending migrations (see [migrations.md](./migrations.md)). Auth is handled in middleware, which sets `event.context.userId`.

### System Layer (`server/system/`)

Infrastructure concerns: `firebase.ts` (the `db()` accessor), `logger.ts`, `request-cache.ts` (per-request memoization), `migration/` (runner + migrations), `sentry/`.

## Cross-Domain Rules

1. **Repositories are private** — A repository is only used within its own domain (`command.ts`, `query.ts`). Other domains access data through public `Query` namespaces. Evans: Bounded Context integrity — each context owns its data and protects its invariants.
2. **Validation at domain boundary** — All data entering a domain is validated/branded (at the GraphQL scalar or in `primitives.ts`). No re-validation internally. Evans: Anti-Corruption Layer.
3. **No domain-to-domain imports of internals** — Domains communicate through public `Query`/`Command` namespaces, never by importing each other's repositories or `infrastructure/`. Evans: contexts communicate through well-defined public interfaces.

## Data Flow

**Simple operation (single domain):**
```
GraphQL request → routes/graphql.ts → Apollo → resolver → domain command/query → repository → Firestore
```

**Orchestrated operation (multi-domain):**
```
GraphQL request → resolver → use-case → multiple commands/queries → Firestore
```

**Query with nested satellite fields:**
```
GraphQL query → resolver (list of beverages) → domain query
             → nested resolver per field (cellar, gift, …) → per-request loader → one batched read
```

## Storage

Native Firestore via `firebase-admin`. The single accessor is `db()` from `server/system/firebase.ts`; it is only called inside `infrastructure/repository.ts`. Each collection is opened with a typed converter:

```ts
import { db } from '~/system/firebase'
import { genericDataConverter } from '~/utils/firestore'

const beverages = () => db().collection('beverages').withConverter(genericDataConverter<Beverage>())
```

`genericDataConverter<T>()` (in `server/utils/firestore.ts`) recursively turns Firestore `Timestamp` values back into JS `Date` on read. Other helpers in the same file:

- **`atomically(batch => …)`** — runs the callback against a fresh `WriteBatch` and commits it once: every enlisted write lands or none does. Reads inside the callback see pre-batch state.
- **`deleteInBatches(refs)`** — deletes many document refs, chunked under the 500-op batch cap.
- **`bulkSave(rows, save)`** — persists many records with bounded write concurrency (used by import/restore, where the row count can exceed a single batch).
- **`userBeverageRecordRepository<T>(collection)`** — a ready-made repository for the satellite collections keyed by the deterministic doc id `${userId}_${beverageId}` (tasting, gift, recommendation).

### Satellite collections & the N+1 rule

Nested `Beverage` fields (`cellar`, `consumption`, `gift`, `recommendation`, `history`) must **never** scan a collection or read one doc per parent row. They resolve through the per-request loaders in `server/domain/shared/graphql/loaders.ts`: each loader is memoized and micro-batched by `beverageId`, so a page of 40 beverages costs **one batched read per selected satellite**, and an unselected satellite costs nothing. Read budgets are asserted in tests via `fake.docReads` / `fake.queryReads` (see [error-handling.md](./error-handling.md) and the testing notes below).

### Per-request cache

`server/system/request-cache.ts` exposes `memoizedPerRequest(key, fn)`: a domain query called several times within the same request reads once. The cache lives on the H3 event context, so it is request-scoped and discarded when the request ends — no cross-request staleness. `isInRequestCache(key)` lets a batched read reuse an already-run full scan for zero extra reads.

## Cross-Domain Reads

Because there is no read-model layer, composite views are assembled in two ways:

1. **In `query.ts`** — a domain query may call another domain's public `Query` namespace. Example: `BeverageQuery.list` filters by favorite/gifted/recommended/in-cellar by calling `TastingQuery`, `GiftQuery`, `RecommendationQuery`, `CellarQuery`. Each of those is a memoized full scan, so the request never pays for it twice.
2. **In GraphQL nested resolvers** — the satellite fields on `Beverage` resolve independently through the per-request loaders, so clients pay only for the fields they select.

## Observability

- **Logging** — structured logging via [consola](https://github.com/unjs/consola). Each module creates a tagged logger:
  ```ts
  import { createLogger } from '~/system/logger'
  const log = createLogger('migration')
  log.info('Applied migration', { version })
  ```
  The factory is in `server/system/logger.ts`. Never use raw `console.log`.
- **Sentry** — initialised in `server/plugins/00-sentry.ts` with the instrumentation in `server/system/sentry/`. Unexpected errors (thrown from resolvers/commands) are captured automatically.
