# Workload Identity Federation: lets the GitHub Actions deploy workflow
# authenticate to GCP without a long-lived service account key. The flow is:
#
#   1. GitHub Actions exchanges its OIDC token at the WIF provider below.
#   2. GCP returns a short-lived token that impersonates the deploy SA.
#   3. Terraform runs apply against this project as that SA.
#
# Outputs (deploy_sa_email + wif_provider) are surfaced through outputs.tf
# so they can be copied into GitHub secrets after a fresh bootstrap.
